- **x1:** higher than average (1.00 vs 0.41 overall)
- **x3:** lower than average (0.00 vs 0.49 overall)

### Cluster 2
- **age:** lower than average (46.68 vs 48.09 overall)
- **x1:** higher than average (1.00 vs 0.41 overall)
- **x3:** higher than average (1.00 vs 0.49 overall)

### Cluster 3

- **x3:** lower than average (0.00 vs 0.49 overall)
- **x1:** lower than average (0.00 vs 0.41 overall)

## Conclusions and Recommendations
Based on the clustering analysis:

1. **Patient Segmentation:** The clusters represent distinct patient groups with different characteristics.
   
2. **Treatment Patterns:** Treatment rates vary significantly across clusters, suggesting potential for targeted interventions.

3. **Outcome Prediction:** Clusters show different outcome rates, indicating that cluster membership could be a useful predictor.

4. **Next Steps:**
   - Consider developing cluster-specific treatment strategies
   - Integrate cluster membership as a feature in predictive models
   - Investigate temporal stability of these clusters with longitudinal data
